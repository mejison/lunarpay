General is a folder where we put front end js scripts for managing modals, widgets etc...
This is for accessing to a functionality from several locations of the dashboard
without the need of duplicating code
EXAMPLE:
    - Add / Substract money, we created an unique modal for opening it from donations, funds, statements, or wherever we want.
      We just need to put a button for opening the modal from donations, funds or statements views.
    - The Js will handle things like AJAX, behaviors etc...
